## Features

### Advanced Features

> These features exist in the official Claude Code codebase but have not been fully released by Anthropic. cc-mini has implemented and ships them.

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| [**Coordinator Mode**](#coordinator-mode) | Runs the assistant as a coordinator that can launch background workers, continue them later, and synthesize their results |
| [**Buddy**](#buddy--ai-companion) | Tamagotchi-style AI companion pet — watches your sessions, comments in a speech bubble, has persistent personality and stats |
| [**KAIROS**](#kairos--memory-system) | Cross-session memory system — save notes, auto-consolidates logs into topic files over time |
| [**Sandbox**](#sandbox) | Runs bash commands inside bubblewrap (bwrap) isolation — filesystem writes and network access restricted |

### Basic Features

- **Interactive REPL** — command history, keyboard shortcuts, streaming output as text is generated
- **Agentic tool loop** — Claude autonomously calls multiple tools per turn until the task is complete
- **6 built-in tools**: `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash`
- **Permission system** — reads auto-approved; writes and bash commands ask for confirmation
- **Conversation management** — session persistence, context compression, and resume support
- **Coordinator mode** — optional orchestration mode with background workers for parallel research, implementation, and verification
- **Skills** — reusable one-command workflows via `SKILL.md` files, built-in and custom

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (3.11+ recommended)
- Anthropic-compatible or OpenAI-compatible API access
- Linux with [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) (`apt install bubblewrap`) — only for sandbox support (optional)

---

## Installation

### One-line install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e10nMa2k/cc-mini/main/install.sh | bash
```

Clones the repo to `~/.cc-mini`, creates an isolated venv, and places a `cc-mini` launcher in `~/.local/bin`. No `sudo` required.

**Options** (set as env vars before the command):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CC_MINI_INSTALL_DIR` | `~/.cc-mini` | Where to clone the repo |
| `CC_MINI_BIN_DIR` | `~/.local/bin` | Where to put the `cc-mini` launcher |
| `CC_MINI_BRANCH` | `main` | Git branch to install |

Example with custom dir:

```bash
CC_MINI_INSTALL_DIR=~/tools/cc-mini curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e10nMa2k/cc-mini/main/install.sh | bash
```

To update, just re-run the same command.

### Manual install (from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/e10nMa2k/cc-mini.git
cd cc-mini
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Usage

### Set API key

Anthropic-compatible setup:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Custom API base URL (useful for proxies or compatible endpoints):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-gateway.example.com
```

OpenAI-compatible setup:

```bash
export CC_MINI_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-openai-gateway.example.com
```

Optional environment variables for runtime defaults:

```bash
export CC_MINI_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5
export CC_MINI_MAX_TOKENS=64000
export CC_MINI_EFFORT=medium
export CC_MINI_BUDDY_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

### Interactive REPL

```bash
cc-mini
```

```
cc-mini  type 'exit' or Ctrl+C to quit

> list all python files in this project
↳ Glob(**/*.py) ✓
Here are all the .py files...

> read engine.py and explain how the tool loop works
↳ Read(src/core/engine.py) ✓
The submit() method implements an agentic loop...
```

Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+C` to quit.

### Coordinator mode

Launch cc-mini in coordinator mode:

```bash
cc-mini --coordinator
```

Or enable it via environment variable:

```bash
export CC_MINI_COORDINATOR=1
cc-mini
```

In coordinator mode, the assistant can use background workers through the `Agent`, `SendMessage`, and `TaskStop` tools. Worker results are delivered back into the main conversation as internal `<task-notification>` messages, so interactive mode is the best fit.

### One-shot prompt

```bash
cc-mini "what tests exist in this project?"
```

### Non-interactive / scripted mode

Use `-p` to print the response and exit:

```bash
cc-mini -p "summarize this codebase in 3 bullets"
```

Pipe input:

```bash
echo "what does engine.py do?" | cc-mini -p
```

### Auto-approve permissions

Skip permission prompts for all tools (use with care):

```bash
cc-mini --auto-approve
```

### Configure API endpoint and model

```bash
cc-mini \
  --provider anthropic \
  --base-url https://your-gateway.example.com \
  --api-key sk-ant-... \
  --model claude-sonnet-4
```

`max_tokens` follows the selected model by default. Override when needed:

```bash
cc-mini --model claude-3-5-haiku --max-tokens 2048
```

OpenAI-compatible example:

```bash
cc-mini \
  --provider openai \
  --base-url https://your-openai-gateway.example.com/v1 \
  --api-key sk-... \
  --model gpt-4.1-mini \
  --effort medium
```

For quick testing, you can also use an OpenAI-compatible gateway such as OpenRouter with a free model:

```bash
cc-mini \
  --provider openai \
  --base-url https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 \
  --api-key sk-or-... \
  --model qwen/qwen3.6-plus-preview:free
```

### Configure with a TOML file

Config files are loaded in order (later overrides earlier):

1. `~/.config/cc-mini/config.toml`
2. `.cc-mini.toml` in the current working directory

Point to a specific file with `--config`.

```toml
provider = "anthropic"  # or "openai"

[anthropic]
api_key = "sk-ant-..."
base_url = "https://your-gateway.example.com"
model = "claude-sonnet-4"

[openai]
api_key = "sk-..."
base_url = "https://your-openai-gateway.example.com/v1"
model = "gpt-4.1-mini"
max_tokens = 8192
effort = "medium"
buddy_model = "gpt-4.1-mini"
```

OpenRouter example for low-cost testing:

```toml
provider = "openai"

[openai]
api_key = "sk-or-..."
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
model = "qwen/qwen3.6-plus-preview:free"
```

Top-level keys are also supported and override the selected provider section when present.

When `provider = "openai"`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` are used. When `provider = "anthropic"`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` are used. If `buddy_model` is omitted, Anthropic defaults to Haiku for companion side-features; OpenAI defaults to the main model so companion features do not break on unknown model names.

## Tools

| Tool | Name | Permission |
|------|------|------------|
| Read file | `Read` | auto-approved |
| Find files | `Glob` | auto-approved |
| Search content | `Grep` | auto-approved |
| Edit file | `Edit` | requires confirmation |
| Write file | `Write` | requires confirmation |
| Run command | `Bash` | requires confirmation |
| Spawn background worker (coordinator mode) | `Agent` | requires confirmation |
| Continue background worker (coordinator mode) | `SendMessage` | requires confirmation |
| Stop background worker (coordinator mode) | `TaskStop` | requires confirmation |

### Permission prompt

When the assistant wants to run a write or bash tool:

```
Permission required: Bash
  command: pytest tests/ -v

  Allow? [y]es / [n]o / [a]lways:
```

- `y` — allow once
- `n` — deny
- `a` — always allow this tool for the rest of the session

---

## Conversation Management

cc-mini automatically saves conversations and can compress long contexts to stay within token limits.

### Session Persistence

Every conversation is saved as a JSONL file under `~/.mini-claude/sessions/`. Messages are appended incrementally — nothing is lost even if the process crashes.

Session metadata also stores whether the conversation was started in normal mode or coordinator mode. When you resume a saved session, cc-mini restores that mode automatically.

```bash
# Resume a previous session by index or ID
cc-mini --resume 1

# Or use slash commands inside the REPL
> /history              # List saved sessions
> /resume 2             # Resume session #2
> /resume a3f2b         # Resume by session ID prefix
```

### Context Compression

When conversations grow long, cc-mini can compress older messages into a structured summary while keeping recent messages intact.

```bash
> /compact                          # Compress with default prompt
> /compact focus on the auth work   # Compress with custom instructions
```

Auto-compact triggers when token estimate exceeds 100k.

How it works:

1. Messages split into **history** (summarized) and **recent** (kept as-is)
2. History sent to API with a structured summary prompt (Primary Request, Key Concepts, Files, Current Work, etc.)
3. Summary replaces old messages; recent messages preserved intact
4. Tool-use / tool-result pairs are never split across the boundary

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/compact [instructions]` | Compress conversation context |
| `/resume [number\|id]` | Resume a past session |
| `/history` | List saved sessions for this directory |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation, start a new session |
| `/skills` | List all available skills |

---

## Coordinator Mode

> This feature exists in the official Claude Code codebase but has not been fully released by Anthropic. cc-mini implements and ships it.

Coordinator mode turns the main assistant into an orchestrator. Instead of doing every substantial step itself, it can launch background workers to research the codebase, implement targeted changes, or verify work in parallel.

### What it adds

- **Background workers** — launch a worker and keep talking in the main session while it runs
- **Continuation flow** — continue a completed worker later with more specific instructions
- **Task notifications** — worker completions are injected back into the main conversation as structured `<task-notification>` messages
- **Session-aware resume** — resumed sessions automatically restore coordinator mode when needed

### Worker tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Agent` | Spawn a background worker with a self-contained prompt |
| `SendMessage` | Continue an existing worker by task ID |
| `TaskStop` | Stop a running worker |

### Typical workflow

1. Start `cc-mini --coordinator`
2. Ask for a larger task such as researching a bug, implementing a fix, or verifying a change
3. The coordinator launches one or more workers in the background
4. As workers finish, their results arrive as `<task-notification>` messages
5. The coordinator synthesizes those results and decides the next step

### Notes

- Workers currently use the standard file/code tools: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Edit`, `Write`, and `Bash`
- Worker execution is asynchronous, so coordinator mode is most useful in the interactive REPL

---

## Skills

Skills are one-command workflows. Type `/name` and the AI runs a full sequence of steps — no need to explain what to do each time.

### Built-in Skills

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/simplify` | Reviews your changed code for duplication, quality, and efficiency — **then fixes it** |
| `/review` | Reviews code changes and reports issues — **read-only, no edits** |
| `/commit` | Runs `git add`, generates a clean commit message, and commits |
| `/test` | Detects the project's test framework, runs it, and analyzes failures |

All skills accept optional arguments:

```
/simplify focus on security
/review only check the API routes
/commit fix login page styling
/test only run test_auth.py
```

### Example

```
cc-mini

> write a fibonacci function to fib.py

↳ Write(fib.py) …
  ✓ done
Created fib.py with recursive and iterative implementations...

> /review

Running skill: /review…
↳ Bash(git diff) …  ✓ done

## Code Review Report
### Warning
- fib_recursive() does not handle negative input
- Missing type annotations
### Suggestion
- Consider adding @functools.lru_cache

> /simplify

Running skill: /simplify…
↳ Bash(git diff) …  ✓ done
↳ Read(fib.py) …    ✓ done
↳ Edit(fib.py) …    ✓ done
Fixed: added negative check, type annotations, lru_cache...

> /test

Running skill: /test…
↳ Bash(python -m pytest tests/ -v) …
  ✓ done
All 3 tests passed ✓

> /commit add fibonacci

Running skill: /commit…
↳ Bash(git add fib.py && git commit -m "feat: add fibonacci") …
  ✓ done
```

### Custom Skills

**Step 1**: Create a directory under `.cc-mini/skills/`

```bash
mkdir -p .cc-mini/skills/deploy
```

**Step 2**: Write a `SKILL.md` file

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy to staging environment
---

# Deploy

1. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
2. Run `./scripts/deploy.sh $ARGUMENTS`
3. Report deployment status
```

`$ARGUMENTS` is replaced with whatever you type after the command. For example, `/deploy production` replaces `$ARGUMENTS` with `production`.

**Step 3**: Use it

```
> /deploy staging
Running skill: /deploy…
```

Skills auto-complete when you type `/`. Use `/skills` to see everything available:

```
> /skills
┌──────────────┬─────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ Command      │ Source  │ Description              │
├──────────────┼─────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ /simplify    │ bundled │ Review and fix code       │
│ /review      │ bundled │ Review code (read-only)   │
│ /commit      │ bundled │ Generate commit and push  │
│ /test        │ bundled │ Run tests and analyze     │
│ /deploy      │ project │ Deploy to staging         │
└──────────────┴─────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

### Where skills are discovered

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| Built-in | 4 bundled skills, always available |
| `~/.cc-mini/skills/` | Personal skills, available in all projects |
| `<project>/.cc-mini/skills/` | Project skills, commit to git and share with your team |

### SKILL.md frontmatter options

```markdown
---
name: deploy                    # Skill name (defaults to folder name)
description: Deploy to staging  # Short description
context: fork                   # fork = runs in isolation (won't affect current conversation)
                                # inline = injected into conversation (default)
allowed-tools: Bash, Read       # Restrict which tools the skill can use
arguments: target               # Argument hint shown in /skills list
---

Your prompt goes here...
Use $ARGUMENTS for user-provided arguments.
Use ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR} for the skill's directory path.
```

## Buddy — AI Companion

> This feature exists in the official Claude Code codebase but has not been fully released by Anthropic. cc-mini implements and ships it.

cc-mini includes **Buddy**, a Tamagotchi-style AI companion that lives in your terminal. Each user gets a unique pet determined by a seeded PRNG — same username always produces the same species, rarity, and stats.

### Quick start

```
> /buddy              # Hatch your companion (first time)
> /buddy              # Show companion card (after hatching)
> /buddy pet          # Pet your companion
> /buddy mute         # Mute companion reactions
> /buddy unmute       # Unmute reactions
```

### How it works

- **18 species**: duck, goose, blob, cat, dragon, octopus, owl, penguin, turtle, snail, ghost, axolotl, capybara, cactus, robot, rabbit, mushroom, chonk
- **Bonus species**: pikachu (braille dot-matrix art) — only available via seed, see below
- **5 rarities**: Common (60%), Uncommon (25%), Rare (10%), Epic (4%), Legendary (1%) — plus 1% shiny chance
- **5 stats** (0–100): Debugging, Patience, Chaos, Wisdom, Snark — these shape how your companion talks
- **ASCII sprite** with idle animation (blinking, fidgeting) in the terminal toolbar
- **Automatic reactions**: after each Claude response, your companion comments in a speech bubble
- **Direct conversation**: address your companion by name and it replies (with conversation memory)

### Use a specific buddy (Pikachu)

You can override the default buddy seed with `CC_MINI_BUDDY_SEED`. Set it to a seed containing "pikachu" to unlock the hidden Pikachu companion (braille dot-matrix art):

```bash
export CC_MINI_BUDDY_SEED=pikachu-3361
cc-mini
> /buddy
```

| Rarity | Seed |
|--------|------|
| Common ★ | `pikachu-21` |
| Uncommon ★★ | `pikachu-116` |
| Rare ★★★ | `pikachu-430` |
| Epic ★★★★ | `pikachu-488` |
| Legendary ★★★★★ | `pikachu-3361` |

To go back to the default buddy:

```bash
unset CC_MINI_BUDDY_SEED
cc-mini
```

### Example

```
> help me fix this bug

Found the issue — off-by-one error in the loop...

(×>) Glitch Honker: Off-by-one again, classic.

> Glitch what do you think of this code?

(×>) Glitch Honker: If it runs, don't ask me philosophical questions.
```

The companion's personality is generated by Claude on first hatch and persists permanently. Stats influence behavior: high Snark = sarcastic, high Patience = supportive, high Chaos = unpredictable.

### Custom Species

You can add your own species with custom ASCII art. Place a JSON file in `~/.cc-mini/buddy/species/` or `<project>/.cc-mini/buddy/species/`:

```json
{
  "name": "pikachu",
  "frames": [
    [
      "   \\\\  //    ",
      "   (\\\\(//    ",
      "  / {E}  {E} \\  ",
      "  |  __  |  ",
      "   \\____/   "
    ],
    [
      "   ))  ((    ",
      "   (\\\\(//    ",
      "  / {E}  {E} \\  ",
      "  |  __  |  ",
      "   \\____/   "
    ]
  ],
  "face": "({E}v{E})"
}
```

- `{E}` is replaced with the companion's eye character at runtime
- Each frame is 5 lines tall, ~12 chars wide
- Provide 2-3 frames for idle animation variety
- The `face` field is used for the compact one-liner display

Custom species are added to the roll pool. Set `CC_MINI_BUDDY_SEED` to control which companion you get.

## KAIROS — Memory System

> This feature exists in the official Claude Code codebase but has not been fully released by Anthropic. cc-mini implements and ships it.

The assistant can remember information across sessions and automatically consolidate memories over time.

### Slash commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/remember <text>` | Save a note to the daily log |
| `/memory` | Show current memory index |
| `/dream` | Manually consolidate daily logs into organized topic files |

**Auto-dream** runs automatically after a turn when ≥ 24 hours and ≥ 5 new sessions have passed since the last consolidation. Configurable via `--dream-interval`, `--dream-min-sessions`, or `--no-auto-dream`.

### Try it out

```bash
# Save some notes and manually consolidate
cc-mini --auto-approve
> /remember I prefer Python over JavaScript
> /remember Our project uses gRPC + PostgreSQL
> /dream                    # reads daily logs, creates topic files + MEMORY.md
> /memory                   # verify the memory index

# Start a new session — the model should recall your preferences
cc-mini
> What do you know about my preferences?

# Test auto-dream (default: 24h + 5 sessions; use flags to lower thresholds for testing)
for i in $(seq 1 3); do cc-mini "session $i"; done
cc-mini --dream-interval 0 --dream-min-sessions 1 --auto-approve
> hello
# Auto-dream triggers after the response
```

Data is stored in `~/.mini-claude/` (memory in `memory/`, sessions in `sessions/`).

---

## Sandbox

> This feature exists in the official Claude Code codebase but has not been fully released by Anthropic. cc-mini implements and ships it.

Runs BashTool commands inside a [bubblewrap (bwrap)](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) sandbox on Linux, restricting filesystem writes and network access. Prevents accidental or malicious destructive operations.

### How it works

When sandbox is enabled, every Bash command is wrapped with bwrap:

- Entire filesystem mounted **read-only** (`--ro-bind / /`)
- Only the current working directory is **writable** (`--bind $CWD $CWD`)
- Network access **isolated** by default (`--unshare-net`)
- Configuration files (`.cc-mini.toml`, `CLAUDE.md`) **protected** from modification
- PID namespace isolated (`--unshare-pid`)

### Sandbox modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `auto-allow` | Sandbox enabled, bash commands auto-approved (no permission prompt) |
| `regular` | Sandbox enabled, bash commands still require confirmation |
| `disabled` | No sandbox (default) |

### Configure via REPL

```
> /sandbox                     # interactive mode selector
> /sandbox status              # show current status and dependency check
> /sandbox mode auto-allow     # enable sandbox with auto-allow
> /sandbox mode regular        # enable sandbox with manual approval
> /sandbox mode disabled       # disable sandbox
> /sandbox exclude "docker *"  # skip sandbox for matching commands
```

### Configure via TOML

Add a `[sandbox]` section to your config file (`.cc-mini.toml` or `~/.config/cc-mini/config.toml`):

```toml
[sandbox]
enabled = true
auto_allow_bash = true
allow_unsandboxed = false
excluded_commands = ["docker *", "npm run *"]
unshare_net = true

[sandbox.filesystem]
allow_write = ["."]
deny_write = []
deny_read = []
```

### Excluded commands

Some commands need to run outside the sandbox (e.g., Docker, package managers). Add patterns to `excluded_commands`:

- **Exact**: `"git"` matches only `git`
- **Prefix**: `"npm run"` matches `npm run test`, `npm run build`, etc.
- **Wildcard**: `"docker *"` matches `docker build .`, `docker run ...`, etc.

Excluded commands still require the normal permission prompt even in auto-allow mode.

### Graceful degradation

If bwrap is not installed or unavailable (non-Linux, Docker without user namespaces), sandbox is automatically disabled. Check with `/sandbox status`:

```
Sandbox Status
  Mode: auto-allow
  Enabled: no
Dependency errors:
  bubblewrap (bwrap) not found. Install: apt install bubblewrap
```

## Tips

- Place a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root — it will be included in the system prompt automatically
- Use `--auto-approve` when running non-interactively or for trusted tasks
- Use `/history` to list past sessions, `/resume` to continue one
- Use `/simplify` after making changes to auto-review and clean up code
- Create project-specific skills in `.cc-mini/skills/` for repeatable workflows
- Conversations auto-compact when approaching 100k tokens; use `/compact` to trigger manually
- Memories persist across sessions in `~/.mini-claude/memory/`; run `/dream` to consolidate
- Type `/buddy` to hatch your AI companion — it watches your coding sessions and comments from the sideline
