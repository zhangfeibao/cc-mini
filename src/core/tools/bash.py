        "verified that a dedicated tool cannot accomplish your task. Instead, use the appropriate "
        "dedicated tool as this will provide a much better experience for the user:\n\n"
        " - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n"
        " - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n"
        " - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n"
        " - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n"
        " - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n"
        " - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n"
        "While the Bash tool can do similar things, it's better to use the built-in tools "
        "as they provide a better user experience and make it easier to review tool calls and give permission.\n\n"
        "# Instructions\n"
        " - If your command will create new directories or files, first use this tool to run `ls` "
        "to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n"
        " - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes in your command.\n"
        " - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths "
        "and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n"
        " - You may specify an optional timeout in seconds (default 120s).\n"
        " - When issuing multiple commands:\n"
        "   - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message.\n"
        "   - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together.\n"
        "   - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail.\n"
        "   - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n"
        " - For git commands:\n"
        "   - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing commit.\n"
        "   - Before running destructive operations (e.g., git reset --hard, git push --force, git checkout --), "
        "consider whether there is a safer alternative that achieves the same goal.\n"
        "   - Never skip hooks (--no-verify) or bypass signing unless the user has explicitly asked for it. "
        "If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue.\n"
        " - Avoid unnecessary `sleep` commands:\n"
        "   - Do not sleep between commands that can run immediately \u2014 just run them.\n"
        "   - Do not retry failing commands in a sleep loop \u2014 diagnose the root cause.\n"
        "   - If you must sleep, keep the duration short (1-5 seconds) to avoid blocking the user."
